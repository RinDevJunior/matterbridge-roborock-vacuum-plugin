## ⚠️ Not Supported Devices

This plugin does NOT support these models:

| Device Name                | Model String                  |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Roborock Q10 Series        | `roborock.vacuum.ss07`        |

**Reason:**
Roborock recently released a new series of models, Q10. Roborock has changed the protocol for how these devices interact.

---

## ⚠️ Other Supported Devices

All other models listed in the code are supported, but **may have some limitations**.

**Reason:**  
I do not own these devices for direct testing.

If you have one of these models, please try it out and let me know your results!
